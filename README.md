Cancer Detection Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately detect the presence of cancer in medical images. Early detection of cancer can greatly increase the chances of successful treatment, and this project aims to aid in that effort by making the process more efficient and accurate.

Installation
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/username/cancer-detection.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd cancer-detection
Install all the required packages for running the project:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Before you can start using the model, you will need to prepare the data by placing the medical images in the data directory. Make sure to organize the images into separate folders for each class (e.g. "positive" and "negative" for cancer presence).

Once the data is prepared, you can run the training script to train the model on the data: python train.py
After the training is complete, you can use the model to predict on new images by running the prediction script: python predict.py
